# Godot Projects, Nov 2021-present

This is a collection of Godot projects that I've been working on.  Been learning since Nov 2021 until now.
I hope to create something fun for everyone to play.

Please check them out!  ~~Though, this repo is ~private, in the time being when I feel a bit more comfortable sharing my work,
I'll open this up to the public.~~
The repo is now public!  I'll be continuing to develop games made with my current partner, @VAGA13OND.
You can assume that most projects here will be made by the both of us.

### Current Project: Project Oasis

Not all of these are solo projects, and I will credit everyone I work with accordingly.  Not sure if that will be in the game folder or
here in the root, haven't decided yet.  Without further ado, thank you for checking out my passions.  I hope they prove to be inspirational
for other aspiring game devs in the future!
